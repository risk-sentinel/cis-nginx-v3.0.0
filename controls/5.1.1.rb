  title 'Ensure allow and deny filters limit access to specific IP addresses'
  desc  "
    Access control based on IP addresses is a fundamental defense-in-depth mechanism. By using NGINX's `allow` and `deny` directives, access to the entire server or specific `location` blocks can be restricted to trusted network sources, such as internal subnets, specific hosts, or VPN ranges. This is particularly effective for protecting non-public administrative interfaces or internal APIs from the public internet.

    Applying the principle of least privilege at the network layer is a highly effective security measure. By explicitly defining which IP addresses or CIDR ranges are permitted to access sensitive resources and implicitly denying all others with `deny all;`, the attack surface is significantly reduced. This prevents unauthorized network segments from even attempting to exploit potential application-layer vulnerabilities.

  desc  'check', "
    Run the following command to inspect the fully loaded NGINX configuration for `allow` and `deny` rules:
    ```
    nginx -T 2>/dev/null | grep -E '^\\s*(allow|deny)'
    ```
    Then, manually review the active rules within the `http`, `server`, or `location` blocks. Verify that the configured IP addresses and CIDR ranges align with the documented list of trusted sources and that a `deny all;` rule is present to enforce a default-deny policy.
  "
  desc  'fix', "
    Identify the specific `location` block you wish to protect (e.g., an admin login page or internal stats). Compile a list of trusted source IP addresses and network ranges. Add `allow` directives for each trusted source, followed by a final `deny all;` directive. NGINX processes rules in order, and stops at the first match.

    ```
    location /admin_login/ {
        # Allow a specific monitoring server
        allow 192.168.1.100;

        # Allow the internal office network range
        allow 10.20.30.0/24;

        # Deny all other access to this location
        deny all;

        # ... other directives for the admin location, e.g., proxy_pass ...
    }
    ```

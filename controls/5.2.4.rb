  title 'Ensure the number of connections per IP address is limited'
  desc  "
    NGINX's `ngx_http_limit_conn_module` provides a mechanism to limit the number of simultaneous connections from a single client IP address. This is achieved in two steps:

    - `limit_conn_zone`: This directive, typically defined in the `http` block, creates a shared memory zone to store the state for each client IP address.
    - `limit_conn`: This directive, applied in a `server` or `location` block, enforces a specific connection limit using the previously defined zone.

    When a client exceeds this limit, NGINX will reject new connections with a `503 Service Temporarily Unavailable` error.

    The primary purpose of connection limiting is to mitigate resource exhaustion and certain types of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks where an attacker opens many connections and holds them open for as long as possible. It is a different tool than rate limiting (`limit_req`), which is designed to stop rapid-fire requests (like brute-force attacks). By enforcing a reasonable connection limit, the server can prevent a single malicious or misconfigured client from consuming an unfair share of worker connections.

  desc  'check', "
    This is a manual check requiring context.

    1. Run the following command to inspect the loaded NGINX configuration for connection limiting rules:
    ```
    nginx -T 2>/dev/null | grep -E '^\\s*(limit_conn_zone|limit_conn)'
    ```
    2. Manually evaluate the findings:
   
    - Is a `limit_conn_zone` defined in the `http` block?
    - Is a `limit_conn` directive applied in the appropriate `server` or `location` blocks?

    Critically, assess the configured limit. Is a limit of `10` appropriate for a public website accessed by customers or large companies? Or is it a sensible value for a specific `/login` location? The value must be justifiable for its context.
  "
  desc  'fix', "
    First, define a shared memory zone in the `http` block. Then, apply a carefully considered limit in the `server` or `location` context.

    Understanding the zone size: 
    The memory usage for the `$binary_remote_addr` key is fixed (`64 bytes` on a 64-bit system). Therefore, `1 megabyte` of zone memory can store approximately `16,384` states. A `10m` zone can store over `160,000` states.

    Example Configuration:

    ```
    http {

        # Define a 10MB zone named 'per_ip' to track connections by IP.
        # $binary_remote_addr is more memory-efficient than $remote_addr.
        limit_conn_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=per_ip:10m;

        server {

            # Apply a general limit of 20 connections per IP for this server.
            # This might be a reasonable starting point for a public site.
            limit_conn per_ip 20;

            # For a resource-intensive download area, apply a stricter limit.
            location /downloads/ {
                limit_conn per_ip 5;
            }
        }
    }
    ```
